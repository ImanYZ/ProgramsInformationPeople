Activities: Week 6 (through fall break)
=======================================

* **Before class Monday:**
  
  * Read :ref:`Try/Except <exceptions_chap>`
  * Read :ref:`String Formatting<formatting_chap>`
  * You may find it helpful to read this `External Tutorial on Reading CSV Files <https://thenewcircle.com/s/post/1572/python_for_beginners_reading_and_manipulating_csv_files>`_
  * Read :ref:`Writing files<write_text_file_chap>` (also note :ref:`Writing CSV files<csv_chap>`)
  * Read :ref:`Python modules <modules_chap>`
  * Make sure to read :ref:`pip module installer <pip_chap>` (and install the ``pip`` module by downloading the `get-pip.py` program and running it with admin permissions -- see Canvas announcement/instructions for help with this if you have any problems!) 
  * Read :ref:`How to Fix Common Problems using your native machine's Python<gotchas_chap>`, which may also be helpful as we move forward.



* **Wednesday's class:**

  * **Your midterm occurs in class today.** Additional information provided in class.


* **Over fall break:**

  * No Problem Set due until the following Sunday, but you should *definitely* get started on the reading and do as much of it as you can -- it's important to understand as clearly as you can so you can ask questions in class!
  * **Make sure your installation and Python setup on your computer is working and feels clear to you. Contact an instructor before Fall Break if this is not the case. This is very important!**
